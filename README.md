# crossterm-display
Light-weight wrapper for [crossterm](https://crates.io/crossterm) that buffers output for increased performance

## On Backwards-Compatibility
No backwards-compatibility guarantees are given because the library is still in development and I'm still figuring out what the API should be.

## Examples
* [Game Of Life](./examples/gol.rs)
If you want to see this library in action also check out [edito-rs](https://github.com/angelcaru/edito-rs)
